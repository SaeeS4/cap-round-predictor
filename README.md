# Cap Round Predictor

## Project Description :
The Cap Round Predictor is a console based python application which helps student predict their chances of admission and assign them to colleges based on marks.

## Team Members : 
* 1] Suryavanshi Sai
* 2] Sahane Sherya
* 3] Waghmare Nilesh
* 4] Sonawane Prathamesh

## Project Phases:
* 1] Planning :-
Try to build a code which predict the chances of admission for a student applying to a specific department at a chosen college. Also outline the structure.
* 2] Development :-
Develop a python based code which includes classes to predict and display a student’s admission chances. Implement robust error handling or incorrect inputs without breaking the program.
* 3] Testing :-
Tests the program’s functionality from user input to admission predictions.
* 4]Documentation:
Include a summary of the endpoints, parameters, and expected responses.
* 5]Requirements :
Software-Python 3.x , IDE (VS code/ Jupyter Notebook) , It contain build in libraries

## How to run the project :
* 1] when you run the program , you’ll see prompts like

## Future scope:-
*  1].Enhancing the Admission Process.
  
      Students often struggle with selecting colleges and courses during admissions. A CAP predictor can provide personalized predictions and recommendations based on their ranks, preferences, and seat availability.
*  2].Expansion to Other Domains.
  
      Such systems can be extended to other admission processes, such as medical, MBA, law, and arts courses, wherever centralized admission systems are used.
*  3].Addressing Student Anxiety.
  
      Admissions can be stressful, especially when students are unsure of their chances. Predictors provide clarity and confidence, reducing anxiety and enabling better decision-making.
